# CCNA Advanced Project Guide

## Introduction
This guide is designed to take someone with zero networking knowledge to an advanced level,
focusing on concepts covered in the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) certification.
The project includes practical labs, theoretical concepts, and advanced configurations.
